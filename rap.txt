Haters say my love is false.
Like false it needs no introduction.
I love you now, tomorrow
and forever by induction.

I heard your latest cdr
Was one of dependent type.
Now I've seen dependent products
And that shit, it just ain't right.

My heart is simply-typed.
It says you and I should be a tuple.
I'll be your cdr; be my car,
Cause #1 is what you are

You can call me Hindley-Milner cause my inference is sound.
I can feel it when we unify;
You're the hottest babe around.
You have no substitution,
so you'd best not let me down.

Now maybe I'm projecting,
But my heart needs no rejecting,
So pass no judgement upon me.
An independent type is what we'll be.
